summary: Different scopes
---
ðŸ’­
Different scopes are covered by worldview, life philosophy, and values, which means they have different subjects. Worldview focuses on the world (broad and extensive), life philosophy focuses on the individual (mostly oneself, with the potential to extend to others, encompassing both broadness and specificity), and values focus on specific things and events (specific and limited). If they all focus on the same object, they can be categorized as a single concept.
